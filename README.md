# 🏡 Housing Price Prediction Project

Welcome to my final project for the Real Estate Investment Trust housing price prediction task.

In this project, I analyze and predict the prices of residential homes based on various attributes such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, number of floors, and whether the home has a waterfront view. I use linear regression and polynomial regression techniques with regularization to build models and evaluate their performance using R² score.

## 📊 Tools & Libraries
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas, NumPy – for data handling
- Seaborn, Matplotlib – for data visualization
- Scikit-learn – for machine learning models
- Statsmodels – for simple linear regression

## 💻 Project Steps
1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
3. **Feature Selection**
4. **Model Training with Linear Regression**
5. **Model Evaluation (R² Score)**
6. **Polynomial Transformation and Ridge Regression**
7. **Comparison of Model Performance**

## 📈 Models Used
- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression (with α = 0.1)
- Polynomial Ridge Regression (Degree = 2)
